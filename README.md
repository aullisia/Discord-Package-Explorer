# Discord Package Explorer

**Discord Package Explorer** is a handy tool for improving your Discord experience. With this app, you can easily explore Discord packages and understand your messaging habits better.

Originally, I created this tool for my personal use, but I've decided to share it with the community so that others can benefit from its features.

## Features

- **Word Frequency Analysis**: check how often you use certain words in your messages. And displays information where you used them!

- **Fun Stats**: Find out interesting information about how you chat, like the words you use most often!

- **Direct Message (DM) History**: Access your entire DM history, allowing you to review the messages you've sent to others while also viewing their information.
